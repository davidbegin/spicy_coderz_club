This repo accompanies a blog post for helping understand the basics of the Vault [Cubbyhole Secret Backend](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/cubbyhole/) and [Response Wrapping](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/response-wrapping.html)

## To get started you will need to:

**Install [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io)**

```
brew install vault
```
*Note: Installation for other Operating Systems can be found [here](https://www.vaultproject.io/downloads.html)*

**Then start a Vault server in [Dev Mode](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/dev-server.html):**
```
vault server -dev
```

**Next determine if you are a Spicy Admin, or Spicy Client:**
